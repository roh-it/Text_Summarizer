# Text Summarizer
Project to summarize text using abstractive text summarization technique using Deep Learning Methods and Transformer models
Transformer Approach - BART (facebook/bart_large_cnn)
Deep Learning Approach - CNN, LSTM

We have borrowed code from one of the research papers and have done few eperiments like changing the architecture, incorporating BLEU scores, chaning the dataset and hyperparameter tuning. The borrowed code placed inside the BorrowedCode_withCustomChanges repository in the main branch. 

Deep Learning models are placed in the DeepLearning_Models Repository.
