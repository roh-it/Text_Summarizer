traffic control tapes obtained by abc news indicated there were large numbers of birds reported near the airpark just before monday crash it was unclear if birds being caught in the plane engines

popularity falling in iowa but maintains lead to become supreme commander of milfistan he wrote by the next morning the tweet was deleted and he had apologized writing apparently charlie sheen got control of my twitter account last night while was at dinner apologies for his behavior but that wasn enough to spare him the ire of conservative women on the blogosphere and twitter on tuesday before carlson first apology stacy drake writing on conservatives palin praised carlson works at the daily caller particularly the leaks of the journolist emails saying that why his tweet stung so badly aside from tucker sheep like response to warped poll numbers he also failed to take ownership of his sexist comment he deleted the original which is why had to link to retweet obviously aware that what he had posted was wrong unfortunately for him many people had already seen it and responded you can put the toothpaste back in the tube tucker is this the sort of treatment that conservative women who want to get involved in the process are expected to put up with is it okay for male columnists conservative or otherwise to continue objectifying women in the world of politics no it not she was unimpressed with his first apology and called for him to apologize to palin while continuing to denounce him for sexism on her twitter account michelle malkin joined the calls tuesday tweeting am not down with karlrove tuckercarlson misogynist mockery of sarahpalinusa sick of it later tuesday carlson obliged sorry for last night tweet meant absolutely no offense not the first dumb thing ve said hopefully the last some bros have come to carlson aid tuesday erick erickson tweeted maybe my sense of humor needs to be recalibrated but when heard tuckercarlson milfistan comment laughed then got out my passport needless to say drake was not amused but by wednesday the thing had escalated into full blown war of the sexes within the conservative blogosphere with whitney pitcher taking carlson tweet as inspiration for her post on conservatives palin milf misogynists and elites like to fulminate perhaps an additional reason that governor palin does not win the respect of the elite and establishment is that you cannot be praised for your perfectly creased pants if you often wear skirt right david brooks the continued line of attack from the establishment and elite men in the gop have come as result of governor palin genetic makeup this post has been updated to correct the spelling of stacy drake first name tucker carlson exposes his own sexism on twitter updated tucker carlson has done some good work in the past his site the daily caller is frequent stop of mine and many other conservatives they were responsible for exposing the journolist scandal which highlighted the planning and coordination of many members of the left wing press will always be grateful to tucker team for bringing that story to light this is also why am so angered by tucker recent actions thought he was better than this if you haven heard by now monday evening tucker carlson posted disturbing tweet about governor palin which said palin popularity falling in iowa but maintains lead to become supreme commander of milfistan aside from tucker sheep like response to warped poll numbers he also failed to take ownership of his sexist comment he deleted the original which is why had to link to retweet obviously aware that what he had posted was wrong unfortunately for him many people had already seen it and responded you can put the toothpaste back in the tube tucker is this the sort of treatment that conservative women who want to get involved in the process are expected to put up with is it okay for male columnists conservative or otherwise to continue objectifying women in the world of politics no it not the best thing tucker carlson could do is admit that what he tweeted was wrong apologize to governor palin and urge his fellow colleagues to be respectful with their language and written word what he did was demeaning and offensive and there is no place for it in conservative circles update this is poor attempt at an apology tucker carlson tries to cover his tracks this morning by repeating the same mistakes he made last night he wrote apparently charlie sheen got control of my twitter account last night while was at dinner apologies for his behavior he didn take responsibility for his comment and he fails horribly at humor try again and tucker you re not funny update ii almost day later he finally apologizes sorry for last night tweet meant absolutely no offense not the first dumb thing ve said hopefully the last time honored parlor game for political pundits is to expose the glaring hypocrisies of their opponents with pithy zingers tradition that has flourished in the character universe of twitter the boilerplate is something like this party is demanding but when the issue is party demands the opposite liberal friendly example

and what are we going to do when their menstruation attracts bears comedy central there plenty more even from carlson who is pretty clearly in no mood to back down here his follow up one tweet too many marks the spot where denis finley editor of the paper in bernie sanders hometown screwed up if oprah winfrey was the media big winner for her golden globes peroration on sexual harassment finley was fortunately less publicized big loser due to ham handed tweets even the most sober of mainstream media get bollixed up over page views and reader engagement as they seek to be more refined barnums of digital age being provocative for provocation sake is increasingly rationalized as way to promote your handiwork no matter how tenuous and fleeting the actual loyalty manifested perhaps with help from drudge report link might be but as finley executive editor of the gannett owned burlington free press unwittingly reminds us there is difference between being responsibly provocative and perhaps tone deaf to your audience especially in the digital age vermont plans to join oregon and washington in offering drivers third option in listing gender on licenses so or in liberal burlington where sanders was mayor it is not unpopular and it just prompted one citizen tweet this is awesome vt is one step closer to offering third gender on driver licenses but finley who came to the free press from virginia in after long stint as norfolk virginian pilot editor and briefly as publicist for norfolk museum felt compelled to respond awesome that makes us one step closer to the apocalypse if winfrey played brilliantly to her audience finley fumbled in recognizing his the vermont online universe is now filled with mostly outrage and claims of canceling subscriptions in fact it was only the third in succession of curious tweets by finley they underscored the tempting perils of journalists even newsroom bosses who feel compelled to opine on well just about anything thus finley saw an associated press tweet on how fans of frank lloyd wright are seeking to prevent the demolition of montana office building designed in this inspired response do not care who designed them destroy all office buildings fine chalk that up to lame humor then after word from none other than the new york times that former president barack obama is to be the first guest on david letterman new monthly netflix talk show he sought to exhibit his inner jimmy kimmel with this another reason not to subscribe to netflix that was lame with smidgen of the obtuse as outrage quickly manifested itself over the gender matter finley seemed to dig deeper hole tim sinnott tweeted that the state policy was awesome because recognition is awesome and finley responded all recognition any recognition tim what if someone said it is awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses am not being snarky am just asking not all recognition is awesome finley was either high mindedly engaged in socratic inquiry as if teaching constitutional law seminar or manifesting jonesean as in alex jones of infowars subtlety cum derision if am top gannett official might now be wondering if second bomb cyclone affecting new england is actually on my payroll so you think trans people are the equivalent of pedophiles anderson asked when tracked down by vermont seven days about the flap he declined comment when contacted him saying maybe in few days finley said really just wanted to ask the question why is that awesome and why is that necessary that all and think any journalist would ask that question he said use of the word apocalypse was inspired by sports illustrated feature signs of the apocalypse when passed through burlington last summer there were still sanders shirts in store windows how long before some retail outlets offer tie dyed image of finley with big fat denis finley does not seem to care that when he enters the arena as executive editor he carries the reputation of his news organization with him reader engagement is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree says tom kearney deputy managing editor of the stowe reporter waterbury record and news citizen of morrisville and executive editor of the shelburne news and the citizen which serves charlotte and hinesburg then there is jon margolis who was an list national political writer during his heyday with the chicago tribune that was pre internet world where reporters and editors were not tweeting their views on everything from whom they would seen at lunch referee call in the nfl game they were watching or of course every breathing moment of donald trump why this urge to tweet so often asks margolis who is retired in south burlington few blocks from the burlington city line do not think the world breathlessly awaits my latest witty aphorism or my personal take on what happened today if have something to offer that worthwhile ll write piece about it that means reporting online on the phone at somebody office and then writing as well as possible which means as succinctly as possible but always more than clicks of the keyboard tweeting is like artificial turf the technology makes it possible not advisable that would apply even where the tweet is not as aggressively ignorant as finley but just think were he writing an article instead of blurt essentially what tweet is he might have read it over and then altered or deep sixed it or had somebody else edit it which even the boss should always do amazing how the conventional processes of newspapers can save us from ourselves jake tapper vs stephen miller jousting between cable tv hosts and guests is now performance fixture bill reilly rode it to riches before his sexual harassment self immolation in its most pedestrian post reilly form it brings some well intentioned but weak liberal saps served up as red meat for fox tucker carlson in fairer tussle it brought us cnn jake tapper and white house aide stephen miller and tapper giving him the boot tapper is evolving into his network prime skeptic of all things trump and unlike carlson not reflexively given to pillorying lightweight guests and miller is the unbridled partisan who has reveled in public combat ever since his high school days at largely liberal los angeles high school as the new york times matt flegenheimer has put it in profile of miller his life is triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance it is story of beliefs that congealed early in home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue state zip code and of an ideology that became an identity for spindly agitator at large and racially divided public high school these formative years supplied the template for the life mr miller has carved out for himself in washington where he remains the hard line jouster many of mr trump most zealous supporters trust most in the white house and many former peers fear this all began with the equally pro forma and dungeon host salutation stephen thanks so much for joining us and happy new year good to see you on sunday miller called michael wolff the garbage author of garbage book rather mediocre pre meditated line for someone of his acerbic and calculating essence he called trump political genius he called it work of pure fiction and pile of trash it was mostly solid fair minded inquisition by tapper for about six minutes until it first got tad personal and each started cutting off the other miller referred to cnn trump coverage as hysterical and tapper suggested it was miller who was being hysterical as if miler were child tapper asked him to settle down settle down at the nine minute mark what had seemed small lull turned sour as tapper brought up letter that miller wrote on the subject of firing then fbi director james comey miller stumbled tad before tapper broached the president bizarre saturday tweet on his own purported genius tapper correctly persisted in broaching the public discourse on trump rationality as miller sought to divert the topic to his theme of cnn being out of touch with working america that his boss understands and cnn doesn then tapper had enough he said that miller was being obsequious playing to an audience of one trump and not answering his question he simply cut him off it was rather abrupt and could have been executed in less peremptory manner it came off as host losing control as much as trump critics loved the scene and think miller deserved it but if you do not want to fight the lions stay away from

are repeated multiple times until it is just she said she said she said she said with the ad ending the truth has power the truth will not be threatened the truth has voice the truth has voice is simple and potent notion but as tv spot it falls bit flat as one top advertising executive told me it is unlikely that most viewers connected the paper incredible sex harassment reporting including on harvey weinstein and the ad for those who who did the event was filled with unavoidable talk of sex harassment in hollywood including seth meyers opening monologue the ad was preaching to the choir potency of advertising involves melding the right media and the right audience in narrow sense the golden globes might seem good target but only in narrow sense the times has great narrative to spin as to why it should be trusted including its admirable attention to fact checking and precision even with some hotly disputed cuts in the copy editing force perhaps larger campaign can include such factors it because the challenge for quality media involves more than the mere declaration of virtue as with changing the attitudes of americans toward sex harassment changing attitudes toward even the best of media especially when it comes to people paying for content will involve military like campaign with no one size fits all messages and the unavoidable and very expensive need to make the

winfrey has been on tv in some ways longer than he has there are lot of reasons why this might make sense to democratic insiders that speech if anything gave people more reason to dream it up for sure

            "Review: breaking news emails get breaking news alerts and special reports the news and stories that matter delivered weekday mornings nov am gmt updated nov am gmt by phil mccausland for weeks student veterans across the country have raised an alarm about delayed or incorrect gi bill benefit payments which the department of veterans affairs has blamed on computer issues but on wednesday the department told congressional staffers that it would not reimburse those veterans who were paid less than they were owed two committee aides told nbc news the news conflicts with promise va officials made to house committee earlier this month that it would reimburse those veterans who received less than the full amount they were due according to the aides however the va said it could not make retroactive payments without auditing its previous education claims which it said would delay future claims the aides asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly nbc news previously reported that some veterans were forced into desperate financial straits stemming from change in calculating housing allowances under the forever gi bill which president donald trump signed into law in july when its computers were unable to process that change the va quickly faced backlog of veterans claims three times higher than normal because of those issues the va had announced earlier on wednesday that it would delay the forever gi bill housing allowance changes until december and again promised that retroactive payments would be made to those who did not receive correct amount but va officials told congressional staffers in telephone call on wednesday morning that once the system is made right next year they will not make retroactive payments to those who were underpaid because of the housing miscalculations they are essentially going to ignore the law and say that that change only goes forward from december one aide told nbc news the reason the va decided that it would not make the retroactive payments is because it would have to audit all its previous education claims prior to december meaning the va would potentially have to inspect million claims the aide said va officials said this could cause further delays in processing future claims according to the aides an issue that caused some veterans to suffer earlier this year while this decision could mean the agency is flouting the law because it would not provide the correct amount of money to student veterans as required by two sections of the forever gi bill the va told the congressional staffers that they have legal justification that would allow them to move forward with this decision they did not share that justification however when asked for comment va spokesman did not address the issue directly instead he reiterated that the agency would delay paying housing allowances in accordance with the new forever gi bill until the spring term of and instead pay housing allowances based on department of defense older basic housing allowance rates attempting to implement the law would put an enormous administrative burden for schools in which some certifying officials would have to track retroactively and re certify hundreds of thousands of enrollment documents curtis cashour the va spokesman said over email cashour also said that students who were overpaid because of the law changes or because of issues in implementing the law will not be held liable for the debt but he did not comment on those who were underpaid and rampant confusion continues to surround the issue as it is unknown how many students have been underpaid thus far how many more could be underpaid because of the changes to the law and how much money these veterans are owed congressional aides described the situation as frustrating one who commented on the shifting answers and constant confusion stemming from va asked mean am taking crazy pills under secretary for benefits paul lawrence is scheduled to testify thursday morning before the house committee on veterans affairs one of the committee aides said that members of congress will attempt to clear this issue up before they move forward with the hearing they need to figure it out the aide said after blowing through the initial deadline to bring its gi bill housing stipends in line with the forever gi bill law veterans affairs department officials said wednesday that they will not be able to implement the fix until december the big delay comes after months of technology hiccups that have plagued the agency which failed to meet the original aug deadline to put the changes in place these problems have contributed to backlog of claims for veterans using the post gi bill to attend school this fall and the agency has come under fire in recent months as thousands of student veterans have had to wait longer than usual for their tuition and housing payments redesigning the way veterans benefits administration calculates post gi bill housing rates during busy academic season was like flying plane while building it and that was unfair and frustrating to veterans and taxpayers that why we are resetting our implementation of the law for the next year to ensure we get the technology and formula right to put veterans first va sec robert wilkie said in news release in the meantime beneficiaries receiving post gi bill housing allowances will be paid at the dod basic housing allowance rate which in many cases will be equal to or higher than their current payment rebootcamp recommendations congressional leaders who have taken the va to task for the slow implementation said wednesday they are glad wilkie is choosing to focus on getting student veterans their payments even if it means pushing back the deadline for the it updates to be completed while am disappointed that the va does not yet have an effective it system in place understand secretary wilkie decision to reset implementation of certain sections of the forever gi bill while improvements continue to be made senate committee on veterans affairs chairman sen johnny isakson ga said in statement right now the va priority must be to ensure accurate payments are sent to student veterans in timely manner student veterans rely on the gi bill to support themselves and their families while they are in school and the va is responsible for keeping those payments going even as it implements the new law rep phil roe tenn whose house committee on veterans affairs pressed va leaders for new deadline in hearing on capitol hill earlier this month said wilkie move will ensure that monthly housing payments are made with minimal delays both lawmakers said they would continue their efforts to hold the va accountable the deaths of three american soldiers in afghanistan this week are tragic reminder of why it so important for the nation to keep its promises to military men and women veterans no matter where they served have volunteered to put their lives on the line and some make the ultimate sacrifice those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they ve earned unfortunately financial aid has been late or gone awol this fall for thousands of veterans and their families relying on the gi bill to get through school the reason big information technology glitch that surfaced with what seemed like relatively minor change in how the aid is calculated while the department of veterans affairs va is trying to fix this lack of communication by the agency about the delays coupled with inaction by the senate has left service members turned students facing severe financial hardships this week the agency was still working to process more than student aid claims on wednesday the va announced that the information technology fixes will not be completed until december more than year past the original aug deadline for finishing this work this is national disgrace one that should prompt congressional leadership to move quickly on short and long term solutions good start would be swift passage of senate bill that would prohibit schools from penalizing student veterans for late va assistance payments this would address major concern that students with accounts in arrears due to delayed payments may not be allowed to enroll for coursework given that the va has said the tech problems will continue until the end of this protection is sensible step the house merits praise for unanimously passing hold students harmless legislation which has been dubbed the sit rep bill but the legislation is bogged down in the senate if ever there was time that it was obvious this bill needed to be passed now is the time said tanya ang vice president of the veterans education success organization in statement provided for nov house veterans affairs subcommittee hearing other testimony provided at the hearing made it clear that long term solutions are urgently needed too the va has lacked permanent chief information officer since january which is unacceptable given how technology is so critical to delivering service members benefits president donald trump nominated well qualified minnesota native james gfrerer last summer but the senate has yet to confirm him the senate is expected to take this up soon but the delay is inexcusable both houses of congress also need to scrutinize much larger problem the antiquated it systems relied on by the va and other federal agencies statement provided to the house by booz allen hamilton the private contractor originally hired to update the va system makes clear the root of the gi bill problem the unfortunate delay has been caused by the confluence of outdated systems being asked to perform ever complex tasks government accountability office report put the age of the va benefits delivery platform at more than half century at that time other agencies such as the treasury department also had so called legacy systems in that age range many use outdated software and hardware parts that are unsupported the report warned the gi bill delay shows how tweak to these dated systems can be complicated and time consuming there likely little appetite in congress to tackle the daunting task of modernization but leadership is sorely needed close dr hilary miller of mtsu works with veteran students on the gi bill that are affected by va technical difficulties mark zaleski and michael schwab staff sergeant robert baker and his family have been affected by va tech issues that has delayed gi bill benefits for months photo submitted staff sgt robert baker was so stressed about money that he made spur of the moment decision and dropped out of all his classes it was already october and he hadn received his gi bill benefits for the start of his fall semester at austin peay state university in clarksville the year old communications major and his wife in her last semester of nursing school are full time students at home they have three young kids ages to freaked out baker said in an interview with the usa today network tennessee told them was going to fall behind on my mortgage was expecting to be paid by the va but since it wasn happening needed to get to work his wife had already picked up second job bartending to make ends meet they re too young to know about the money aspect but they know mommy is gone so much baker said of his kids who he watches at alone at night after day of classes they were feeling our stress baker left the army this summer after years in the service including deployments to iraq in and kuwait in he was stationed in fort campbell for four years he wanted to take advantage of his gi bill so he enrolled for classes just month after the army discharged him but the money never came he said we were just shocked we were angry because we figured this would be automatic baker said come to find out there were big problems going on at the va there are many veterans like baker in tennessee and across the country who are still waiting for the department of veterans affairs to clear backlog created after president donald trump signed the forever gi bill in while the landmark legislation expanded benefits for new generation of veterans and their families it didn upgrade the va antiquated technical capabilities to account for those changes problems are centered within the va office of information technology which is tasked with implementing the change to how housing allowances are calculated the va said the new bill changed it so that veterans housing would be based on the school zip code rather that where the veteran lived problems arose when the va attempted to stress test their outdated system as well as contract dispute as result the va waited until july to tell schools to begin enrolling students the delay caused backlog of claims meaning thousands of students had to wait for their benefits just as they were headed back to school for the fall semester post sept military affiliated students particularly first time students like baker were mostly impacted on nov state rep jay reedy erin and leaders in the tennessee house and senate wrote letter to rep phil roe johnson city and members of the house committee on veterans affairs urging them to take immediate action roe chairs the committee nationally there are fewer than veterans who have an education claim that has been pending over days and less than who have claim that been pending for over days as of nov according to va spokesman curt cashour universities step in to help students but where the va failed universities across the state have stepped up to help students many schools are utilizing percent interest loans and tuition deferment as ways to ensure student veterans receive the financial support they need continue their education as result institutional funds at several schools have been heavily drawn down creating budget concerns baker said after he dropped his classes he came to the realization that he would have to pay the school back for the months he is already been in class it was just going to hurt me more financially was freaking out and called admissions he said they said it ok we ll fix it apsu has some military affiliated students on campus according to retired brig gen scott brower who joined the institution this year as its first military adviser in residence about in tuition was deferred by the university for students impacted by the delay and students have taken out short term loans offered by the school totaling according to brower we recognize this is on the va and that they will fix this problem we ve been treating it with good faith knowing that money is not available for them right now he said we want to make sure we are doing everything we can so that students are continuing on their goal for degree completion middle tennessee state university in murfreesboro has done the same for its students according to hilary miller the director of the daniels center resource for the nearly veterans and military families on campus it was terrible she said speaking of the delays she said about

students on the gi bill who have not received their benefits for months due to va technical difficulties photo mark zaleski for the tennessean miller said the school deferred their tuition and had short term loans available for students to hold them over until their benefits had been processed the school also had template letters for students to use with landlords explaining their situation we asked our community members to extend grace to our veterans and that this was nothing the veterans did she said students reached out to say that they could not pay for books and that it impacted their productivity in the classroom the school contacted staff and faculty to make sure they were aware of the situation and asked if they could make copies of textbook pages in certain cases we did everything we could do to make it easier but if you are not getting paid for couple of months there is not lot we can do to make it easier miller said va alarm did not go off the delays varied greatly for students at east tennessee state university in johnson city some students were processed within hours but in many cases students had to wait months to see any money we were calling month later

trying to cancel their federal student loans for three years in federal court the obama department of education told them to keep on paying improbably the trump administration is poised to say different under preliminary accord the federal government would invite tens of thousands of former students who more than years ago attended beauty and secretarial schools owned by defunct wilfred american education corp to petition the education department to cancel their unpaid debt and receive refunds on past payments according to four people familiar with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing confidential settlement negotiations the applications are almost certain to be approved these people said and the government would foot the bill the deal which is not complete and may change would resolve class action lawsuit against the education department brought by seven former wilfred students who claimed the feds for decades had been wrongfully collecting on debt that students needn repay federal law allows borrowers to cancel their loans when their schools violate certain rules and wilfred routinely flouted the law by falsely certifying that its students were eligible for government loans according to the complaint the lawsuit claimed the department knew the loans were eligible to be forgiven yet it made no effort to inform debtors of this right if finalized the settlement would represent one of the largest debt forgiveness schemes undertaken by the education department that it did not happen under obama who championed student debt relief measures and instead could happen under trump who in november agreed to pay million to settle several lawsuits tied to his own foray into for profit education could upend expectations that trump overseen education department would favor the interests of for profit schools over those of allegedly defrauded students jim margolin spokesman for preet bharara the former attorney in manhattan whose office is arguing the case on the government behalf declined to comment so did camilla jenkins spokeswoman for new york legal assistance group whose lawyers represent former wilfred students and eileen connor who also represents former wilfred students as the directer of litigation at harvard law school project on predatory student lending jim bradshaw an education department spokesman didn return messages seeking comment wilfred was once one of the largest for profit school operators in the country with schools and more than students in court documents show like many for profit schools it recruited low income women with the promise of higher paying job and better life former students alleged it reportedly ran advertisements around welfare offices federal student loans and grants were responsible for most of wilfred revenue allegations of impropriety haunted the company for much of its existence authorities sued the company several times alleging fraud and in wilfred was found guilty of mail fraud and making false statements in two separate criminal cases in federal court in an education department employee wrote in memorandum to her bosses that systemic violations of federal student aid rules had been discovered at wilfred schools as early as court filings show she recommended that many student loans connected to wilfred should be discharged as result we have made substantial progress toward final settlement jane greengold stevens lawyer for the former wilfred students said in march court filing she asked to meet with district judge robert sweet to discuss certain nonstandard procedures the two sides are considering before they submit potential settlement for court approval ana salazar the lead plaintiff in the suit against the education department is among some people who took out government guaranteed student loans to attend wilfred she claimed in court papers that she signed federal financial aid forms when she enrolled in even though she didn speak english at the time the settlement discussions began in earnest last year after the federal appeals court in manhattan overruled district court ruling in favor of the obama administration that dismissed salazar lawsuit on technicality the trump administration could decide to reject any final settlement and wilfred students hopes have been crushed before for example in june few months after they sued the feds president barack obama ordered the education department to improve how it communicated with vulnerable borrowers struggling with their debt sign that the administration might ultimately agree with former wilfred students two weeks later the education department tried to dismiss the wilfred lawsuit by arguing that it was under no obligation to inform debtors that they could discharge their potentially invalid loans the indications coming from the trump education department so far is that it may be abandoning students who have been abused by for profit colleges said david halperin lawyer in washington and frequent critic of for profit schools if in fact the administration approves strong settlement it would suggest there is hope yet \n",

spies and militants bryan is assigned to listen in on man named haroon and paul keeps an ear on fazl flood of details one officer on the lashkar taiba beat let slip that some of his eavesdropping turned out to be largely pointless perhaps because of the agency chronic shortage of skilled linguists he ran some queries to read intercepted communications of certain lashkar taiba members he wrote in the wiki but added most of it is in arabic or farsi so can make much of it it is glimpse of the unsurprising fact that sometimes the agency expensive and expansive efforts accomplish little despite

rather fundamental flaw over messages in one week did not come in the report said about one target those are daily course corrections whether the snowden disclosures will result in deeper change is uncertain joel brenner the agency former inspector general says much of the criticism is unfair reflecting na vet about the realpolitik of spying the agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it supposed to do he said but mr brenner added that he believes technology has outrun policy at the and that in an era in which spying may well be exposed routine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish another former insider worries less about foreign leaders sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home william binney former senior official who has become an outspoken critic says he has no problem with spying on foreign targets like brazil president or the german chancellor angela merkel that pretty much what every government does he said it the foundation of diplomacy but mr binney said that without new leadership new laws and top to bottom reform the agency will represent threat of turnkey totalitarianism the capability to turn its awesome power now directed mainly against other countries on the american public advertisement continue reading the main story think it already starting to happen he said that what we have to stop whatever reforms may come bobby inman who weathered his own turbulent period as director from to offers his hyper secret former agency radical suggestion for right now my advice would be to take everything you think snowden has and get it out yourself he said it would certainly be shock to the agency but bad news doesn get better with age the sooner they get it out and put it behind them the faster they can begin to rebuild closer look examining the news sept this closer look has been updated with response from the office of the director of national intelligence propublica is today publishing story in partnership with the guardian and the new york times about and government efforts to decode enormous amounts of internet traffic previously thought to have been safe from prying eyes this story is based on documents provided by edward snowden the former intelligence community employee and contractor we want to explain why we are taking this step and why we believe it is in the public interest the story we believe is an important one it shows that the expectations of millions of internet users regarding the privacy of their electronic communications are mistaken these expectations guide the practices of private individuals and businesses most of them innocent of any wrongdoing the potential for abuse of such extraordinary capabilities for surveillance including for political purposes is considerable the government insists it has put in place checks and balances to limit misuses of this technology but the question of whether they are effective is far from resolved and is an issue that can only be debated by the people and their elected representatives if the basic facts are revealed it certainly true that some number of bad actors possibly including would be terrorists have been exchanging messages through means they assumed to be safe from interception by law enforcement or intelligence agencies some of these bad actors may now change their behavior in response to our story in weighing this reality we have not only taken our own counsel and that of our publishing partners but have also conferred with the government of the united states country whose freedoms give us remarkable opportunities as journalists and citizens two possible analogies may help to illuminate our thinking here first historical event in shortly after the world war ii battle of midway the chicago tribune published an article suggesting in part that the had broken the japanese naval code which it had nearly all responsible journalists we know would now say that the tribune decision to publish this information was mistake but today story bears no resemblance to what the tribune did for one thing the wartime code breaking was confined to military communications it did not involve eavesdropping on civilians the second analogy while admittedly science fiction seems to us to offer clearer parallel suppose for moment that the government had secretly developed and deployed an ability to read individuals minds such capability would present the greatest possible invasion of personal privacy and just as surely it would be an enormously valuable weapon in the fight against terrorism continuing with this analogy some might say that because of its value as an intelligence tool the existence of the mind reading program should never be revealed we do not agree in our view such capability in the hands of the government would pose an overwhelming threat to civil liberties the capability would not necessarily have to be banned in all circumstances but we believe it would need to be discussed and safeguards developed for its use for that to happen it would have to be known there are those who in good faith believe that we should leave the balance between civil liberty and security entirely to our elected leaders and to those they place in positions of executive responsibility again we do not agree the american system as we understand it is premised on the idea championed by such men as thomas jefferson and james madison that government run amok poses the greatest potential threat to the people liberty and that an informed citizenry is the necessary check on this threat the sort of work propublica does watchdog journalism is key element in helping the public play this role american history is replete with examples of the dangers of unchecked power operating in secret richard nixon for instance was twice elected president of this country he tried to subvert law enforcement intelligence and other agencies for political purposes and was more than willing to violate laws in the process such person could come to power again we need system that can withstand such challenges that system requires public knowledge of the power the government possesses today story is step in that direction update statement from the office of the director of national intelligence it should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways to counteract our adversaries use of encryption throughout history nations have used encryption to protect their secrets and today terrorists cybercriminals human traffickers and others also use code to hide their activities our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that while the specifics of how our intelligence agencies carry out this cryptanalytic mission have been kept secret the fact that nsa mission includes deciphering enciphered communications is not secret and is not news indeed nsa public website states that its mission includes leading the government in cryptology in order to gain decision advantage for the nation and our allies the stories published yesterday however reveal specific and classified details about how we conduct this critical intelligence activity anything that yesterday disclosures add to the ongoing public debate is outweighed by the road map they give to our adversaries about the specific techniques we are using to try to intercept their communications in our attempts to keep america and our allies safe and to provide our leaders with the information they need to make difficult and critical national security decisions \n",

are taking steps to leave the state the siskiyou county board of supervisors voted on tuesday to pursue seceding from california the redding record searchlight reported proponents say siskiyou should form new state called jefferson with other counties in northern california and southern oregon they believe share similar interests on tuesday more than people filled the supervisors chambers many of whom indicated support for the declaration the searchlight reported when speaker asked those in the audience who was in favor nearly every hand in the room was raised the newspaper said many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our god given rights said happy camp resident gabe garrison we need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life the state of jefferson is the place want to raise my son kayla brown said resident complaints include lack of representation in sacramento and insufficient attention to major issues for the county such as water rights and rural fire prevention fee the searchlight reported we have to have government that is local understands our issues and has empathy said mark baird rancher who the searchlight said was heading the effort supervisor marcia armstrong cited restoration of limited government as one of the reasons she supported the declaration we also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us she said supervisor ed valenzuela who chairs the board was the only vote against the decision the searchlight said he cited the oath he took upon his reelection to uphold the constitution and uphold the constitution of the state of california signed on to work within the system know he said do not like it do not agree with it all the time but did sign up for that and will continue to do so neighboring counties which would be invited to join jefferson are also weighing secession humboldt county supervisor rex bohn told the times standard that his board would probably meet to consider their options was one of the people who thinks the state of jefferson was not bad idea he told the newspaper there has been total lack of respect of our water rights and the fire fee those things may not be important to the rest of the state but it is important to us secession efforts within california date back to the the most recent high profile attempt came in when riverside county officials weighed proposal to pursue the establishment of south california which would have seen counties leave the golden state for the record pdt sept an earlier version of this post incorrectly attributed humboldt county supervisor rex bohn comments on the state of jefferson to the redding record searchlight they were made to the times standard also rim fire containment of yosemite area blaze at youtube video shows long beach police repeatedly striking suspect girl wounded in car to car shooting in palmdale three in custody twitter katemather google kate mather latimes com the siskiyou county board of supervisors voted on tuesday to support the county split from the state of california it the first in long series of steps to form the proposed state of jefferson which proponents of the effort say would bring representation to rural north state counties that currently are beholden to the whims of representatives of the more heavily populated southern california and free them from burdensome state regulations we have to have government that is local understands our issues and has empathy for those affected said mark baird scott valley rancher who is also president for scott valley protect our water and vice president of the siskiyou water user association baird is leading the charge to form new state from rural counties in northern california and southern oregon though he certainly was not the only voice in support of the move more than people packed the supervisors chambers tuesday for the discussion on whether the county should issue declaration that it wants to secede from the state nearly all those in attendance appeared to be for the move and about dozen spoke in support of it many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our god given rights said gabe garrison of happy camp we need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life among those in attendance was erin ryan field representative for rep advertisement doug lamalfa when asked for the congressman opinion she said that she and other lamalfa staff members supported the effort to secede but she did not know lamalfa thoughts on it she also said there is support for the split in sacramento the discussion also attracted members of groups from shasta and tehama counties who are looking for their own supervisors to pass similar declarations it would be the only way could see everyone coming together in positive manner said tom moller of red bluff also there was kayla brown mother in her early who said she did not want to raise her child in california the state of jefferson is the place want to raise my son she said at one point in the meeting speaker asked for show of hands from those in attendance who supported the split nearly every hand in the room was raised and supervisors echoed much of that enthusiasm in their own comments have not had one contact in regard to this issue that is in opposition supervisor michael kobseff said supervisor marcia armstrong said the issues were about regulation restriction of rights lack of representation regionalism and restoration of limited government we also have this enormous bureaucracy of unelected officials making decisions for us she said board chair ed valenzuela was the sole vote against the declaration he said he was elected to solve problems within the system it comes down to because took an oath took an oath when ran for re election which just did and that was to uphold the constitution and uphold the constitution of the state of california he said and within that and because knowing what it is like to be minority know the value of having to work from the other side without the numbers and without support signed on to do that signed on to work within the system know do not like it do not agree with it all the time but at the same token did sign up for that and will continue to do so in august county residents lobbied the board to consider separating from the state over laundry list of complaints including lack of representation in sacramento for the republican majority county issues pertaining to water rights and the rural fire prevention fee if the county were to split from the state any action taken today would be the first step in long process that would require approval from the state legislature and the congress siskiyou county would also invite other neighboring counties in california and southern oregon to join in the effort to create new state the constitution allows for the formation of new states though land cannot be taken from existing states without the consent of state and federal governments humboldt county st district supervisor rex bohn said he can understand the frustration in siskiyou county and that he tends to agree with most of the issues that were brought up by the board was one of the people who thinks the state of jefferson was not bad idea bohn said there has been total lack of respect in terms of our water rights and the fire fee those things may not be important to the rest of the state but it is important to us this is major thing for everyone that lives rurally bohn said the problem is that only percent of the state is rural and decisions in sacramento are sometimes based on the needs or realities of more urban areas it kind of drastic measure to get someone to listen to you but guess they feel like they are not getting heard he said bohn added that the humboldt county supervisors will likely meet to discuss the issue humboldt county rd district supervisor mark lovelace said he took the talk of secession as statement of frustration there has to be basic economic underpinnings to make state work lovelace said there is certain romantic appeal and allure to the state of jefferson this entire idea of what could have been but in reality it would not be good economically he said one of the problems with rural county seceding is that the tax base starts small siskiyou is one of the

lumia range so far enough to keep interest in windows phone alive most analysts are seeing certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition even if they are split on what its biggest implications are forrester mobile analyst charles golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other windows phone licensees has left microsoft with just nokia as its standard bearer and added microsoft now appears poised to adopt vertically integrated strategy more akin to apple but he said microsoft challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands windows nokia live surface xbox bing and more into cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty that tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board choice of new ceo he said richard holway chairman of analyst techmarketview said given that microsoft paid bn for skype in the price it is paying for nokia seems extremely reasonable however he added our only surprise now is the timing of the announcement for such big deal to come just days after ballmer stood down seems mighty strange for holway there is also an opportunity for the enlarged microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts there is undoubtedly market opportunity for the creation of provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise taking office onto various mobile platforms providing secure emailing in sector once occupied by blackberry but such move carries its own risks microsoft success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it already its move into the tablet market with surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the pc if nokia rumoured tablet appears too this will further complicate microsoft relations with these partners who are essential for the success of windows as well as office and other products but as holway points out on balance microsoft needed to make bold move into mobile not doing so would mean certain terminal decline this way at least holds out some chance of survival carolina milanesi research vice president at analyst gartner said by buying rather than just partnering with nokia microsoft gets deeper integration the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of nokia either going android or being acquired by someone else but success against ios and android will depend on how the companies integrate nokia benefits from higher spend as well as more marketing budget microsoft benefits from good relationship with carriers good direct channel presence in emerging markets the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market she told zdnet but for milanesi business is secondary concern even if it is an attractive target where microsoft and to less extent nokia have experience first and foremost it needs to be about consumers enterprise are certainly target especially considering the state blackberry is in but consumers make or break phone vendor today from milanesi point of view emerging markets need to be longer term target for microsoft but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first for forrester principal analyst thomas husson nokia adds to microsoft developing market strategy it looking increasingly likely that the us and western european smartphone market is reaching saturation so that most growth will come from emerging markets here nokia asha devices could play neat role as an on ramp for consumers buying their first smartphone tied in with revamped tablet strategy this could open up new front against android in particular but husson cautioned this is going to be long journey in some countries windows phone market share is now above five percent and close to percent it thus still offers limited reach for developers and marketers nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with far east manufacturers and low cost android devices think it will depend on microsoft new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones all of this shows the number of competing and occasionally contradictory demands upon microsoft management as the incumbent player in fading market microsoft has take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future for example balancing microsoft business customers against the need to get into consumer tech the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside and building up mobile business while protecting its pc heritage it easy to look at apple integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it but it is much harder to emulate global coverage nokia interim ceo microsoft deal makes us stronger even with nokia devices microsoft wants to license windows phone to other makers does its nokia buy thwart or fuel possible microsoft break up microsoft shows how to flush decades of nokia goodwill away microsoft gets less than per windows phone unit microsoft nokia deal reaction from the twitter trenches elop drops nokia ceo role to lead devices team under microsoft deal further reading microsoft is buying nokia cell phone business and licensing its patent portfolio according to both companies in nokia cell phone market share exceeded that same year its phone business alone posted an operating profit of billion euros today sale price which includes billion euros in patents is just billion euros it been rough decade nokia cell phone collapse has been spectacular one the finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after motorola another faded star that recently fell into the hands of comparative upstart but it was blindsided by apple then deprived of chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive google which followed close behind the story in hindsight is simple nokia did not have truly compelling smartphone ready when large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones whether this was the result of complacency nokia was in the mid the leader of the niche smartphone category does not matter now nokia miscalculations became impossible to ignore in the same year microsoft decided internally at least to scrap its ancient and inadequate windows mobile platform in favor of something entirely new under these circumstances it is easy to imagine how sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time or at least mutual sympathy certainly shared interest to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled during the next two years while microsoft readied windows phone and nokia floundered on the seeds of sunday deal were sewn chastened nokia was natural partner for the tardy but determined microsoft it needed software solution and microsoft needed help with hardware the vision of renders clearly two giants united after some missteps regain their rightful place by when the head of microsoft business division left to take the helm at nokia the gears were moving many at the time wondered if stephen elop time at nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase foreigner in all possible ways he began his time at the company with memo rightly but offensively declaring nokia proud platform failure and quickly pledged the company commitment to the still tiny windows phone it felt like radical about face but no matter nokia and microsoft were going to save each other now with elop returning to microsoft after job well done well job done that plan has come to fruition the only problem is that there is little left to save windows phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market nokia has not had windows phone hit this incongruity between successfully executed slyly strategic long term merger plan and much grander more general sense of failure might explain microsoft deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its nokia acquisition microsoft strategic rationale titled accelerating growth is disjointed and bizarre document it manages to sound both insane and uninspiring outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic for example it lays out plan to pull in over billion dollars in smartphone revenue by but it plans on doing this by securing just of the projected global smartphone market not exactly world beating plan keeping in mind the time frame consider is five years away five years ago was the year the app store first opened in surprising move early tuesday microsoft announced that it would be acquiring nokia devices and services division effectively making the finland based phone maker first party hardware manufacturer for windows phone devices and their related services stephen elop will step aside as ceo of nokia and return to microsoft as head of its devices team this all on the heels of the recent announcement that steve ballmer would step down as microsoft ceo within the next months the verge had chance to speak with steve and stephen as well as nokia board of directors chairman risto siilasmaa about the massive transition ballmer was particularly talkative though he sounded weary either from jet lag or very long month however the current ceo would not give up details on whether elop was prime candidate for the top slot at the company as many have speculated our board is going through process open to internal and external candidates it process that they wanted well known so they could consider everybody internally and externally stephen elop happens to be going from external to internal but our board will consider everybody they will do it in private that is the right way for the board to conduct its business the deal was in place before ballmer announced his retirement according to ballmer the deal was in place before the public announcement of his plans to exit the company before announced my plans shortly before called risto because wanted him to understand that the transaction was important to us despite my plans that it was consistent with the strategy of microsoft and our board it was not my action and wanted them to know about it before we finalized this deal talked to stephen elop about it everybody remained enthused about the deal and about stephen joining microsoft so that is all happening and independently our board will go through with the succession activity on the transition itself ballmer said he felt this was all part of longer plan hinting that perhaps the first few years of tight partnership with nokia were trial run for the deal today would not say this was always in the cards over the last few years we have thought about our possibilities and strategic options to make sure we had success in phones would say was going through fairly diligent examination of that at about the time nokia decided to take look at opportunities two and half plus years ago and we leapt at the opportunity to form strategic partnership we invested in that partnership as has been well documented we love the partnership and yet by the early part of this year it was clear to me that perhaps acquisition would be way to accelerate called risto right after the first of the year sometime in january early february we met at mobile world congress he wanted to make sure we exhausted all possibilities since we were going to be partners in any event whether we did deal like this or had variety of other modifications to our operating partnership think that was valuable exercise in terms of really identifying what are the key things for us to do to really accelerate our partnership and think we are better in announcing this deal on both sides for having gone through that exercise but ultimately this is where we landed ballmer added that the company is not just interested in the hardware business but deeply invested in nokia services as well people will focus in on the phone side think it is as important that we were able open up set of innovation possibilities working with here location services which we are not acquiring but the way in which we formed deal where we could do more innovation around building off of the great core technology and data assets at here is also an important part of the deal today we look forward to being one of the big customers of here nokia will be company that goes on and is in the business of network infrastructure mapping advanced technologies but the team that we acquire from nokia stephen will lead the microsoft devices efforts and the windows phone will be the anchor tenant in terms of volume of our first party hardware and of course that the lumia product line we re not naive about the amount of work that we have in front of us it unclear how ownership of nokia hardware division will allow microsoft further agency or purchase when it comes to gaining ground in the phone market but ballmer clearly thinks the acquisition makes the process simpler and can lead to deeper market penetration think we have done good work we re not na ve about the amount of work that we have in front of us the key is to drive volumes driving volumes will activate the software and the hardware ecosystem we do see an ability to speed our agility in hardware and software innovation we do think that making the brand and the product line simpler and easier to acquire and being able to invest with greater agility should do lot to help us continue to improve our market share and position which certainly will help our apps ballmer even lightly broached the topic of struggling ecosystem on the software side and we do know and are focused in on in every way shape and form addressing both the app side of the ecosystem as well as the operators with whom nokia has actually build phenomenal relationships think they so far have been uniformly enthusiastic about our ability as one company to invest even more successfully in windows phone we actually have an opportunity to create better opportunities for oems as to whether this move threatens partners that microsoft has been working with in the phone space ballmer was predictably upbeat though it is hard to imagine htc and samsung are feeling particularly warm about their windows phone offerings at the moment we actually have an opportunity to create better opportunities for oems ballmer said the number one thing that it takes to create opportunities for oems is large market and our first party in phones will blaze the trail and perhaps as importantly having phone be healthy part of the windows ecosystem will help the oems the many oems we have who are focused on tablets pcs and all in ones etc so both on the phone side and it particularly helps our oems on the tablet and pc side whether or not this ultimately helps microsoft well that is drama yet to play out but nokia stock is trading up over percent in helsinki few hours after the acquisition was announced of jekaterina kapanen leaves the nokia mobile phone

to one in three staff as it loses market share to cellphone rivals apple and samsung and burns through cash raising new fears over its future in second profit warning in nine weeks nokia said on thursday that its phone business would post deeper than expected loss in the second quarter due to tougher competition which it expected to continue once the world dominant mobile phone provider nokia was wrongfooted by the rise of smartphones and is struggling to keep up with apple samsung and google it is also losing market share in cheaper more basic phones chief executive stephen elop is placing hopes of turnaround on new range of smartphones called lumia which use largely untried microsoft corp software but lumia sales have so far been slow exasperating investors who have seen its stock crash more than percent since it announced the software switch in february the job cuts and profit warning underline the seriousness of the challenges nokia is facing particularly in light of the eye watering competition from apple and samsung said ben wood head of research at ccs insight nokia whose cash position is increasingly scrutinized by investors also said restructuring related cash outflows would be around million euros in the remaining three quarters of and around million in with the cost of nokia debt rising the most bearish of analysts in reuters poll last month said the company could even be at risk of default if it fails to slow its cash burn over the past five quarters the onetime darling of mobile telcoms has eroded its cash pile by billion euros rate that would wipe out its entire billion reserves in couple of years analysts at jp morgan said on thursday they expect operating losses combined with restructuring outflows to leave nokia with billion euros cash at the end of next year this is not comfort zone for company as large as nokia the analysts said nokia five year credit default swaps cds were at new all time high of basis points on thursday according to markit this means it costs annually to buy million of protection against nokia default using five year cds contract and implies default probability of percent bernstein analyst pierre ferragu said he expects the company to have minimal net cash position at the end of its restructuring we therefore see continued potential downside to the recent stock price and maintain our underperform rating ferragu said shares in nokia were down percent to euros below the psychologically important euros mark not seen since analysts have said that even with the dramatic fall in the share price the worsening outlook made it hard to judge how much lower the shares could go will not comment on the stock price anymore since it is been seen over and over that there is no definitive bottom said evli analyst mikko ervasti people are worried over lumia sales think expectations for the third quarter will be cut said nordea analyst sami sarkamies the job cuts which include the closure of nokia only plant in its homeland finland bring total planned cuts at the group since elop took over as chief executive in to more than staff or every third worker of the latest job cuts will take place in finland where the firm will also close its plant in salo the last major cellphone manufacturing site in western europe the cradle of the global industry this is major blow this is due to the operational mistakes made already during the previous ceos maybe the signs of success are running low for elop too said antti rinne chairman of labor union pro nokia said it expects its operating margin in the second quarter to be below the negative percent level reported in the first quarter due to pressure on its smartphone business it previously forecast it would be similar to or below that level on average analysts forecast the second quarter phone unit margin to be at percent narrowing to percent in the third quarter nokia also said it would sell luxury phone business vertu

            "Review: after year in which liberals scored impressive high profile supreme court victories conservatives could be in line for wins on some of this term most contentious issues as the justices consider cases that could gut public sector labor unions and roll back affirmative action at state universities however as the court new term kicks off monday uncertainty surrounds several other politically potent cases that could wind up on the court agenda story continued below litigation over state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors is making its way to the high court and the justices are already facing batch of petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing contraception under obamacare both issues seem likely to land on this term docket although the justices haven formally taken up either many in the obama administration would also like to see the court weigh in on immigration in coming months upholding the president right to grant quasi legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the illegally as children but it unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for decision this term or whether obama effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by lower court order until the president leaves office here politico look at five of the most important cases the justices could grapple with soon potential body blow to labor public employee unions and politicians of both parties are keenly focused on california dispute about whether states can compel government employees to pay union dues loss for the unions could sharply diminish the clout of movement already struggling with its political relevance the case friedrichs california teachers association was brought by orange county calif schoolteacher rebecca friedrichs and other teachers who are arguing that forcing them to pay union dues violates their first amendment rights they also contend that unions should have to get permission before collecting dues used for political purposes as opposed to the current system that requires objecting employees to opt out the significance is substantial either way it comes out said university of california at irvine law professor catherine fisk the reason why conservative lawyers are bringing these case is the hope that significant number of government employees choose not to join the union and certain government employee unions will be weaker the roberts court has not been friendly to unions issuing ruling last year that prohibited mandatory union fees for home health workers but stopped short of banning so called agency shops in government the new case directly asks the justices to overturn year old precedent that allows all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation how the case will be resolved is unclear partly because the conservative justices often see limits on government employee first amendment rights when their speech is at issue fisk said the unions are rationally fearful about what the court will do but she thinks the justices might end up dumping the case after it heard think the case raises so many doctrinal problems for them she said higher ed affirmative action back in the crosshairs two years after punting the case back to an appeals court the justices will take second crack at resolving dispute about the constitutionality of the university of texas at austin affirmative action program the case was brought by rejected applicant abigail fisher who contends she was rejected because of her race the last time fisher case went before the high court affirmative action opponents hoped it would serve as vehicle to pare back preferences for racial and ethnic groups at government run schools however the justices instead told the th circuit it had been too deferential to the university of texas claims that the programs were narrowly tailored to promote diversity justice anthony kennedy won the support of six other justices for decision that said such programs must be handled with strict scrutiny but the decision did not suggest they were automatically unconstitutional justice elena kagan has recused herself because she was involved in the case during her previous service as solicitor general the real question is whether kennedy will join the four other republican appointees in setting such high bar for affirmative action that many public colleges will abandon the preferences and admissions practices they use to achieve racial and ethnic diversity the meaning of one person one vote texas case has the potential to deal blow to latino political clout tilting the balance of power away from urban areas and towards suburban and rural areas with more white voters evenwel abbott presents the question of whether state legislative districts can be apportioned using count of eligible voters rather than count of all people if immigrants both illegal and legal as well as children can be left out of the count the rural areas where voters tend to have fewer non citizens or where there are fewer young people concentrated would necessarily gain said new york university law professor rick pildes it reasonable inference if the urban areas are more democratic leaning that they would lose power to more republican rural areas congressional redistricting shouldn be directly affected by the case pildes said because the constitution says the census used for that reapportionment should be based on each state population but others say the ruling could spill over into congressional redistricting down the line religious nonprofits and obamacare in the hobby lobby case last year the justices allowed for profit companies to seek religious exemptions from obamacare coverage requirements but now several religious affiliated schools and institutions including the little sisters of the poor nursing home in denver have filed lawsuits too they argue that the administration process for allowing religious nonprofits to opt out of the contraception requirement requires them to violate their religious beliefs the supreme court has eight petitions including one that just arrived from the federal government on this issue some prominent judges are effectively begging the supreme court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others how ironic that this most consequential claim of religious free exercise with literally millions of dollars in fines and immortal souls on the line should be denied when nearly every other individual religious freedom claim has been upheld by this court th circuit judge edith jones complained in dissent last week how tragic to see the humiliation of sincere religious practitioners which coming from the federal government and its courts implicitly denigrates the orthodoxy to which their lives bear testament and both ironic and tragic is the harm to the judeo christian heritage whose practitioners brought religious toleration to full fruition in this nation undermine this heritage as our founders knew and the props of morality and civic virtue will be destroyed the justices haven signaled which of the challenges if any they ll consider but are expected to do so in the coming weeks testing when abortion clinic regulations go too far two of the latest tactics in the abortion wars could wind up before the justices this term requirements that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that abortion clinics meet standards for hospitals or surgical centers an appeals court has upheld most such limits in texas but in june the supreme court voted to block key parts of the law until the justices decide whether to weigh in petitions to take up that case and similar law in mississippi are already pending at the supreme court supporters of the laws say they are designed to protect women health but abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the laws would force many clinics to close and penalize poor women who could not afford travel to distant clinics similar wisconsin law led to combative oral arguments in front of the th circuit last week judge richard posner suggested the law was transparent effort to prevent abortions not aid women governor walker before he withdrew from the presidential competition said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies as result judge richard posner said to lawyer for the state in remarks first reported by the milwaukee journal sentinel is that kind of official wisconsin policy that perhaps is governor walker personal view but it not state policy assistant attorney general brian keenan replied keenan insisted requiring doctors to have admitting privileges was reasonable precaution to aid women the admitting privileges would benefit the continuity of care for the woman when she goes to that hospital he said posner said the fact that the law was intended to kick in one business day after it was passed made clear the authors intentions that statute can be justified in terms of women health the judge said jennifer haberkorn contributed to this report in

washington ap tie vote from the supreme court on tuesday handed win to labor unions in high profile dispute over their ability to collect fees the justices divided in case that considered whether public employees represented by union can be required to pay fair share fees covering collective bargaining costs even if they are not members the split vote leaves in place an appeals court ruling that upheld the practice the result is an unlikely victory for organized labor after it seemed almost certain the high court would rule to overturn regime in place nearly years the court is operating with only eight justices after the death of justice antonin scalia who had been expected to rule against the unions the one sentence opinion does not set national precedent and does not identify how each justice voted it simply upholds decision from the th circuit court of appeals that applies to california and eight other western states the union case is among handful of high profile disputes in which scalia vote was expected to tip the balance toward result that favored the conservative justices since supreme court decisions are not final until they are handed down nothing scalia did or said in connection with the case before his death mattered to the outcome group of california teachers backed by conservative group said being forced to pay union fees violated the free speech rights of nonmembers who disagree with the unions positions they had urged the justices to overturn nearly year old supreme court decision that allows the unions to collect the fees the high court had raised doubts about the viability of the precedent abood detroit board of education but it stopped short of overturning it in two recent cases in abood the court said public workers who choose not to join union can be required to pay for bargaining costs if the fees do not go toward political purposes the lead plaintiff was rebecca friedrichs public school teacher from orange county california who said she resigned from the california teachers association over differences but was still required to pay about year to cover bargaining costs the case affects more than million workers in states and washington who are represented at the bargaining table by public sector unions labor officials worried the potential loss of tens of millions of dollars in fees would reduce their power to bargain for higher wages and benefits for government employees labor leaders called the lawsuit part of coordinated effort by conservative groups to weaken labor rights union officials say the fees are necessary because it has legal duty to represent all teachers at the bargaining table even those who are not part of the union close from abortion services to undocumented immigrants here are some of the cases that could be affected by justice scalia absence video provided by newsy newslook supreme court justice antonin scalia death will tilt the balance in the court major cases this term photo adrian sainz ap washington the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia is major setback for the conservative legal movement as will become clear in the months ahead this was to be the term conservatives roared back after one in which the court liberal bloc won most of the important cases such as same sex marriage and obamacare on tap to be decided in the next four months are cases affecting abortion rights affirmative action voting rights the power of labor unions and president obama health care and immigration policies and conservatives stood at least chance of winning them all not anymore scalia untimely death saturday at texas ranch leaves an empty seat on the supreme court almost surely for the remainder of the term and most likely for the duration of obama presidency while the white house and congressional democrats would like to fill the seat their chances of prevailing on those important cases and others improved markedly that because the court is now divided evenly between liberals and conservatives in fact tilted slightly to the left because justice anthony kennedy often takes the liberal side tie votes would uphold the lower court ruling only the abortion and immigration cases were decided in conservatives favor at that level here look at the biggest cases pending before the court their current status and potential outcome in the wake of scalia death voting rights heard dec the court is considering changing the way state and municipal voting districts are drawn by allowing them to be based on the number of eligible voters rather than total population that would render non citizens invisible in the count along with children prisoners some ex felons and some people with intellectual disabilities the result more rural mostly white districts during oral argument in december it seemed the conservative justices might have five votes to move away from using total population but they could not come up with practical alternative making it long shot that the status quo using total population is reversed for that reason scalia absence may not affect the outcome affirmative action heard dec in crucial test of university admissions programs that take race into consideration the court conservatives appeared ready in december to cut back on affirmative action at the least it seemed the university of texas austin program would be affected scalia played leading role during oral argument noting that some briefs submitted to the court suggested that african americans may do better at less advanced or slower track schools do not think it stands to reason that it is good thing for the university of texas to admit as many blacks as possible he said without his vote the school program still could be doomed because liberal justice elena kagan is recused setting up possible vote labor unions heard jan this is the case that conservatives seemed most assured of winning until now during oral argument the conservatives sharply criticized the current system in which public employees in states and the district of columbia must pay for the cost of collective bargaining even if they disagree with union demands with kennedy leading the way the court appeared likely to strike down that requirement which would reverse the lower court and deal major blow to the financial clout of public employee unions such as the california teachers association now tie vote looms which would uphold the system abortion to be heard march abortion clinics in texas are challenging state law upheld in lower courts that imposes tough new restrictions on doctors and facilities the case has shaped up to be the biggest one affecting reproductive rights since now however it appears that if supporters of abortion rights do not win outright with the support of kennedy or another conservative justice tie upholding the texas law would not set new national precedent for federal courts to follow contraception to be heard march religious non profits such as charities schools and hospitals are seeking an exemption from the affordable care act mandate that employers pay for contraceptives as part of standard health insurance plans they stood good chance of winning with scalia on the bench now the most likely outcome is tie that would leave the so called contraceptive mandate in place for those non profits immigration to be heard in april president obama already had decent chance of reversing an appeals court ruling and winning about six months to begin implementing his immigration plan which would shield more than million undocumented immigrants from deportation but that was by no means sure thing without scalia the president still needs the vote of at least one conservative justice to win the case tie would preserve the lower court decision against the program but without setting national precedent read or share this story http usat ly tjrwwz \n",
